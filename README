Examples demonstrating how to use Gradle to build Flex applications.

These examples have been created and tested with Gradle 1.0 Milestone 3.

The projects are broken down into:

* HelloWorld

A single application that prints "Hello world" on the screen when run.

* HelloWorldMultiProject

Demonstrates Gradle's multi-project support to build a "Hello world" application that uses a library (SWC) to supply the text.

* SingleLibrary

Compile a library (SWC) project.

* Git Submodules *

This project uses a Git submodule to include the Gradle Flex plugin as a buildSrc directory (have a look at Gradle's documentation on writing plugins for more info).

You need to run some additional Git commands to get the submodules setup correctly (these must be run in the top-level directory of the Git project):

git submodule init
git submodule update

* Pre-requisites *

You need to create a FLEX_HOME environment variable pointing at the root directory of a Flex 4.1 SDK.

* Caveats *

I've only tested this on the Windows platform.
